## First Steps 

### **1. Initial Setup**
- [ ] Install Python and set up a virtual environment.
- [ ] Install Flask and other required libraries (e.g., `flask-mysqldb`, `mysql-connector-python`).
- [ ] Set up a Git repository for version control.

---

### **2. Database Setup**
- [ ] Design the database schema for recipes (e.g., tables for users, recipes, ingredients, categories).
- [ ] Create the MySQL database and tables.
- [ ] Connect Flask to the database using MySQL.
- [ ] Add seed data for initial testing (optional).

---

### **3. Flask App Basic Structure**
- [ ] Create the Flask app structure:
  - `/static/`: For CSS, JS, images.
  - `/templates/`: For HTML templates.
  - `/app.py`: The main application file.
  - `/config.py`: For configuration settings like database credentials.
- [ ] Set up the `app.py` with basic routes and configurations.

---

### **4. Templates and Frontend**
- [ ] Create a base template (`base.html`) with a common layout and navigation bar.
- [ ] Set up a home page template (`index.html`).
- [ ] Create templates for:
  - Viewing a single recipe.
  - Adding a new recipe.
  - Editing a recipe.
- [ ] Add Tailwind CSS for styling.

---

### **5. Routes and Backend Logic**
- [ ] Set up routes:
  - Home (`/`): Display a list of recipes.
  - Recipe details (`/recipe/<id>`): Show detailed recipe information.
  - Add recipe (`/recipe/add`): Form to add a recipe.
  - Edit recipe (`/recipe/edit/<id>`): Form to edit a recipe.
  - Delete recipe (`/recipe/delete/<id>`): Delete a recipe.
- [ ] Implement backend logic for CRUD operations.

---

### **6. Adding Interactivity**
- [ ] Include Alpine.js in your templates for interactivity.
- [ ] Use Alpine.js for:
  - Toggling ingredient lists.
  - Showing/hiding forms.
  - Adding client-side validation feedback.

---

### **7. User Authentication (Optional)**
- [ ] Add user login/logout functionality.
- [ ] Allow users to save favorite recipes or manage their own recipe lists.

---

### **8. Testing and Debugging**
- [ ] Test all routes and forms.
- [ ] Validate database queries and connections.
- [ ] Use Flask's debug mode to catch and fix errors.

---

### **9. Deployment**
- [ ] Set up the project on PythonAnywhere.
- [ ] Configure the MySQL database on the server.
- [ ] Push your code and test the live app.
